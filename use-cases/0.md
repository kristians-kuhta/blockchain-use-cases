# Peer-to-peer carpooling

## Use case description
By leveraging the benefits of blockchain technologies, carpooling can be made more decentralized.
Driver reviews, transactions and other data can be stored on-chain, therefore ensuring trust among users.

Since there is no centralized authority, you wouldn't have to pay high commission fees for using the service, making the service more cost-effective for both parties.

You could use Decentralized Identity solutions to identify yourself without giving third parties access to your data, which can then be sold by them or leaked during an attack on their systems.
