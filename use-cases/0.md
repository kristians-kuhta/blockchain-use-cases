# Peer-to-peer car pooling

## Use case description
By leveraging the benefits of blockchain technologies, car pooling can be made more decentralized.
Driver reviews, transactions and other data can be stored on-chain, therefore ensuring trust among users.

Since there is not centralized authority, you wouldn't have to pay high commision fees for using the service, making the service more cost-effective for both parties.

You could use Decentralized Identity solutions to identify yourself without giving third parties access to your data, that can then be sold by them or leaked during an attack on their systems.
